Stack and Queue both are Linear data structures.
-->     In the linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other.
-->     The traversing of data in the linear data structure is easy as it can make all the data elements to be traversed in one go, but at a time only one element is directly reachable.
