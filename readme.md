Stack and Queue both are Linear data structures.
- In the linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other.
- The traversing of data in the linear data structure is easy as it can make all the data elements to be traversed in one go, but at a time only one element is directly reachable.<br>

* Stack
- A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come out.
